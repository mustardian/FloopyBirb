# Floopy Birb
Made on June 25th 2020

Made using Pygame. The game FloopyBirb is basically a recreation of the 
popular iOS game Flappy bird. I’ve learnt the basics of Pygame such as how 
to draw graphics on screen and handle user input. I’ve also learnt how to 
handle various different game mechanics such as character movement, 
collision and handling score. Now to provide a good user experience I’ve also 
learnt how to manage and draw frames properly per second.
